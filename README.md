Samples to support the Interspeech 2018 (Visit Interspeech 2018 here) submission titled "Reconstructing neutral speech from prosthetic esophageal speech". More details can be found in our paper.

This page contains following samples:

PE-Speech: These are the recorded speech from a larygectomee.

Baseline-1(B1): These are reconstructed neutral speech from PE speech without whisperizing it prior to the neutral speech synthesis.

Baseline-2(B2): These are similar to B1, with residual substituted with Gaussian white noise in neutral speech synthesis.

Baseline-3(B3):These are reconstructed neutral speech from PE speech using a method proposed by Mcloughlin et. al(link)

Baseline-4(B4): These are similar to B3, While B3 takes the PE speech, directly as input, B4 considers the whisperized speech as input.

Pe2N: These are reconstructed neutral speech using proposed PE-Speech to neutral speech conversion method.
